Unsnap/undock gesture
- Even if the flick is very light - if this is a flick out of a docked position.
  - It shouldn't cause the window to snap back and rather it should animate to the nearest non-snapped position.

Snap experience
- Windows snap rotate too easily. need a better way to control it.
  Perhaps only snal rotate when the window is flicked at the edge or goes beyond a certain threshold

Other
- Snap to side of screen
- Snap to other windows
  - Consider automatically docking the windows together

- Dock containers
  - Implement logic similar to that of VS to enable easy docking of windows
